# Happy-number
This Python program helps you check whether a number is happy.
A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

1-Starting with any positive integer, replace the number with the sum of the squares of its digits.
2-Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1.
3-Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
